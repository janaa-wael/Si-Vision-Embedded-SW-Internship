# Session 5 Notes:

- Copy Assignment Operator Overloading is what get called when you do this:

  - Steps:

    1- Self-assignment check (if i'm assigning the object to itself, we shouldn't waste execution time by copying)

    ```
    if(this == &other)
    	return *this;
    ```

    2- Clean up the current resources (using delete function)

    ```
    if(literals != nullptr)
    {
    	delete[] literals;
    }
    ```

    3- Copy values from the source object (using Deep Copy Technique)

    ```
    literals = new char[other.size+1];
    memcpy(literals,other.literals,other.size);
    size = other.size;
    literals[size]= '\0';
    ```

    4- Return *this

    5- Function Signature:

    ```
    MyString& operator=(const MyString& other)  
    ```

    - **We return object of the class by reference to support call chaining as in the following line:

      ```
      MyString& operator=(const MyString& other)
      ```

- The compiler automatically generates a default destructor, a default copy constructor and a default assignment operator. If a class defines one or more of the previous functions, it should explicitly define all of them.

  <u>***Why?***</u> if one of the three functions is user-defined, it'll probably involve working with expensive resources like heap allocation. When heap allocation is involved, the default copy constructors and assignment operators will do **shallow copying** which will cause errors on destruction and the default destructor will not free the allocated resources.

- This rule is only a programmer-guide rule. The C++ doesn't enfore compilers to follow the rule of three.

- Question: What function is called?

  ```
  int main()
  {
  	MyString name4 = "hi";
  }
  ```

  1- RHS is RValue ?? Creates temp location in memory >> Parameterized Ctor

  2- Copy from temp location to name4 >> Copy Ctor

  3- Destruction of temp location

  4- Desctruction of name4

  INSTEAD, it's better to use this syntax:

  ```
  int main()
  {
  	MyString name4("hi");
  }
  ```

  ![image-20250717202806139](C:\Users\hp\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20250717202806139.png)

  - **Why inheritance?**

    - defines an "Is-A" relationship between the parent and the child.

    - Child classes inherit properties of the parent class (i.e.: data members, methods)

    - The ability of a class to derive properties and behavior from another class is called **Inheritance**. It introduces a new level of objects relationship called "Is-A".

    - Inheritance models real-life example using hierarchial scheme where objects carry different labels:

      1- Parent/Super/Base Class:

       - A class whose properties are inherited.

      2- Child/Derived Class:

      - A class that inherits properties from another class.

    - A class can be a parent and a derived class at the same time.

    - Suppose the following classes exist:

      ![image-20250717203723826](C:\Users\hp\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20250717203723826.png)![image-20250717203758011](C:\Users\hp\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20250717203758011.png)

      -> This implementation leads to "Compilation Error", because private members can't be accessed by child classes.

      ![image-20250717203908878](C:\Users\hp\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20250717203908878.png)

  - A child object inherits the member variables and functions from the base class.

  - That doesn't mean that the child gets a copy of the members.

  - A child object consists of two parts, a base object & a child object where each one is instantiated **solely**.

  - Parent object is constructed first before the child object.

  - What if the base and child classes have member vairables to be initialized?

    1- Memory for derived is allocated to fit in the Base & Derived portions.

    2- The appropriate derived constructor is called **<u>but not executed</u>**.

    3- The initialization list initializes variables of the Base Object.

    4- The base object's constructor is executed (default or user-defined)

    5- The initialization list initializes variables of the **<u>Child object</u>**.

    6- The child object's constructor is executed (default or user-defined)

    7- Control is returned to the caller.

  - In child class constructors, we can control which base class constructor to be called.

  - When the derived class doesn't specify a constructor for the parent class to be called, **the default base constructor is called**.

  - Explicitly calling the base constructor is used to initialize the base class members.

    ```c
    class TeamLeader : public Employee
    {
    private:
    	string teamName;
    public:
    	TeamLeader() : Employee("777", "Jana", 23)
    	{
    
    	}
    };
    ```

  - Access Specifiers:

    - The protected section in the base class is accessible to the derived classes (in addition to the base class nad friend functions and classes)

    - There are three types of inheritance:

      1- Public Inheritance
      The inherited public members stay public, and the inherited protected members stay protected.

      2- Protected Inheritance:

      The inherited protected and public members become protected.

      3- Private Inheritance [Default]

      The inherited public and protected members become private.

    - The private members are never inherited.

  - What happens if there are 2 methods/data members in the Base & Child classes with the same name?

    â€‹	--> We can differentiate between them using the scope operator.

    ```c
    class Parent {
    public:
    	void print()
    	{
    		cout << "Parent is here!" << endl;
    	}
    };
    
    class Child : public Parent{
    public:
        void print()
        {
            cout << "Child is here" << endl;
            Parent::print();
        }
    };
    int main()
    {
        Child object;
        object.print();
        //Base Called!
    }
    ```

- Overriding Behaviors:

  - If a base class defines a function, it can be overridden by the child class. This means the child class can replace the implementation defined in the base class with a new implementation.

    ```c
    Base.print(); // Base here
    Child.print(); // Child here
    ```

    

  ```c
  class MyStringImproved : public MyString
  {
  private:
  	int* ptr;
  public:
  	MyStringImproved() : ptr(new int)
  	{
  	
  	}
  	MyStringImproved(const char* literals) : MyString(literals), ptr(new int) {}
      // You must implement the copy constructor even if it's implemented in the base class!
      // The base class only deep-copies its own data members, not that of the children! 
      // SO, the copy constructor of the hcild should deep-copy its data members, too!
  	MyStringImproved(const MyStringImproved& other) : ptr(new int)
      {
          memcpy(ptr, other.ptr, 4);
          cout << "Copy Constructor of Child Class" << endl;
      }
  	~MyStringImproved()
  	{
  		if(ptr!=nullptr)
  		{
  			delete ptr
  		}
  	}
  }
  
  int main()
  {
      MyStringImproved str1("hi");
      MyStringImproved str2(str1); 
  }
  ```
