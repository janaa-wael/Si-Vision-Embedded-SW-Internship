# Difference between stdio and tinystdio in Picolibc

- ## `stdio` in picolibc

  - Picolibc is designed for **small embedded systems**, so its `stdio` implementation:
    1. **Is smaller and more configurable** than glibc’s `stdio`.
    2. Can be built in different modes:
       - **Full stdio** → more complete functionality (wide I/O, formatting, floating-point printing if enabled, etc.).
       - **tinystdio** → a reduced-size version with simpler code and smaller RAM/flash footprint.

- `tinystdio` in picolibc

  - `tinystdio` is the small-footprint implementation of the C standard I/O library (`stdio.h`) — basically, a minimal version of `printf`, `scanf`, `fopen`, etc., optimized for embedded systems with very limited flash and RAM.
  - Why does it exist?
    - Full-featured `stdio` from glibc/newlib is large (tens of KB of code).
    - Many embedded projects only need basic formatted output/input.
    - `tinystdio` implements just enough of `stdio` for most small programs, cutting size drastically.
  - It's part of picolibc, you can choose it at build/configure time.
  - It replaces the normal stdio functions (`printf`, `puts`, etc.) with smaller, simpler ones.
  - It's focused on **ROM size**, not necessarily speed or full POSIX compatibility.
  - Doesn’t support every advanced feature (e.g., locale, wide chars, complex format specifiers).
  - Often combined with **`minimal-printf`**-style features for microcontrollers.
