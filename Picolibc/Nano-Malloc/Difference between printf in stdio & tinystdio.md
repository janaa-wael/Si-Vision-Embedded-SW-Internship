### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Implementation Complexity**

- **`stdio`**:
  - Full-featured implementation, closely aligned with the C standard.
  - Handles wide formatting options (width, precision, flags, locale, floating point, long long, etc.).
  - Has layered buffering (`FILE*` streams, `fputc`, `fwrite`, etc.) and hooks for user-provided backends.
  - Uses larger lookup tables and more code paths.
- **`tinystdio`**:
  - Minimal reimplementation designed for *embedded systems* with constrained ROM/RAM.
  - Implements only a subset of the formatting options (e.g., may lack `%f`, `%e`, precision, locale handling).
  - Writes directly to output sinks with less buffering logic.
  - Focuses on reducing binary size instead of completeness.

------

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Code Size (Text Section)**

- **`stdio`**:
  - Larger code size due to complete feature support.
  - Can add several kilobytes to your firmware.
- **`tinystdio`**:
  - Much smaller â€” typically a few hundred bytes to 1â€“2 KB.
  - Achieves this by **stripping features** (e.g., no floating-point printing unless explicitly enabled).

------

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Output Backend**

- **`stdio`**:
  - Goes through the **`FILE` structure**, using its buffering and function pointers (`put`, `get`, `flush`).
  - More flexible, but more overhead.
- **`tinystdio`**:
  - Often uses a **direct write function** (e.g., `_putchar` or a user-provided callback).
  - No layered buffering by default.

------

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Formatting Features**

- **`stdio`**:
  - Supports almost everything required by ISO C (including `%f`, `%e`, `%g`, `%a`, `%n`, wide characters).
  - Full width/precision flags, padding, alignment.
- **`tinystdio`**:
  - Only basic formats (`%d`, `%u`, `%x`, `%s`, `%c`).
  - May have optional floating-point support, but often cut down (no exponential form).
  - Fewer flags (like `0`, `-`, width).

------

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Use Cases**

- **`stdio`**: Best if you need portability, correctness, and full compliance (like in Linux/glibc).
- **`tinystdio`**: Best if youâ€™re targeting **MCUs with <64 KB flash** and donâ€™t need full `printf` power.
